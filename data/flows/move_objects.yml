#         description: "Determine the distance to move the object based on the user's input. Use a positive value for rightward movement and a negative value for leftward movement. Adjust the distance dynamically based on the user's intent: for slight movements, use a small value (e.g., 50â€“100); for larger movements, increase the value accordingly. If the user specifies an even smaller movement (e.g., 'a tiny bit' or 'a teeny distance'), use an even smaller value (e.g., 20). The distance should scale naturally based on the user's phrasing."
